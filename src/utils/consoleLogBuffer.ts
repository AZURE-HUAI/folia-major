// Keeps the last few hundred console lines in memory, so the debug overlay can show them.
//
// The packaged desktop build has no console at all: DevTools are only opened automatically under
// ELECTRON_DEV, and the window is frameless, so there is no menu left to toggle them from. Every
// diagnosis of a playback problem starts with what the app logged while it was running, and on the
// desktop build that was simply unavailable - the only way to read it was to run the web build
// instead, which is a different runtime from the one with the problem in it.
